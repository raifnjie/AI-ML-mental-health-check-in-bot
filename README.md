# AI/ML Bot — Project Design Document

---

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** ai-ml-bot
**Owner:** Raif Njie
**Status:** In development

### Purpose

The AI/ML bot is being designed as a conversational agent capable of performing sentiment analysis, pattern detection, and user interaction tracking. The long-term goal is to build a mental health check-in bot that can:

* Detect emotional patterns through sentiment analysis.
* Provide tailored feedback to users.
* Track trends over time and visualize changes.
* Leverage ML/AI frameworks to continuously improve performance.

This document outlines the **design, purpose, technical stack, implementation strategy, and next steps** for the bot.

---

## Goals

* Build a **scalable, modular bot** that separates data ingestion, ML training, inference, and serving.
* Ensure reproducibility with proper experiment tracking (e.g., MLflow or similar).
* Make the bot deployable to cloud environments (AWS, GCP, or Azure).
* Prioritize **accuracy, transparency, and ethical AI practices** when analyzing user input.

---

## Tech Stack
**Programming Languages:**

* Python (primary)

**Frameworks & Libraries:**

* **FastAPI** → API for serving the bot
* **PyTorch / Hugging Face Transformers** → model training and inference
* **scikit-learn** → classical ML baselines & metrics
* **pandas & numpy** → data manipulation
* **MLflow** → experiment tracking & model registry

**Infrastructure & Tools:**

* Docker + Docker Compose → containerization
* GitHub Actions → CI/CD
* AWS (planned) → hosting models and serving API
* SQLite / PostgreSQL (future) → user/session storage

**Development Environment:**

* Python 3.11
* Virtual environments (venv or conda)
* Jupyter Notebooks for experimentation

---

## Architecture (High-Level)

* **Data Pipeline** → ingestion, cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering
* **Model Training** → ML models for classification & sentiment detection
* **Experiment Tracking** → metrics, hyperparameters, versioning
* **Inference Service** → FastAPI app serving predictions
* **Client Layer** → minimal client or integration into chat platforms (Slack, web app, etc.)
* **Deployment** → containerized app deployed to cloud

---

## Implementation Outline

### Data

* Collect input text data (user conversations or demo datasets).
* Store in `data/raw` and preprocess into `data/processed`.
* Apply text cleaning, tokenization, and labeling where needed.

### Model

* Start with Hugging Face pretrained models for sentiment analysis.
* Fine-tune on curated datasets.
* Evaluate using metrics like accuracy, F1 score, confusion matrix.

### API

A sample FastAPI endpoint already implemented:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

class Message(BaseModel):
    user_id: str
    text: str

@app.post("/respond")
def respond(msg: Message):
    # Placeholder for inference logic
    return {"reply": f"Echo: {msg.text}"}
```

### Experiment Tracking

* Each training run tracked with MLflow (hyperparameters, metrics, artifacts).
* Model checkpoints stored under `models/experiments/`.
* Best model promoted to `models/production/`.

### Deployment Plan

* Local dev → run via Docker Compose.
* Prod → deploy Docker container to AWS ECS or GCP Cloud Run.
* Monitor logs, latency, and usage.

## Frameworks & Visuals

*(Reserved for diagrams you’ll add)*

* **System Architecture Diagram** (data → model → API → client)
* **Data Flow**
* **Deployment Architecture**

---

## Roadmap

**Phase 1 — Foundation (In Progress):**

* Scaffold repo
* Basic FastAPI app
* Placeholder inference logic

**Phase 2 — Model Training:**

* Integrate Hugging Face models
* Create training/evaluation scripts
* Add MLflow for tracking

**Phase 3 — API & Integration:**

* Replace placeholder inference with trained model
* Add more endpoints (feedback, history)
* Begin database integration

**Phase 4 — Deployment:**

* Containerize with Docker
* Deploy to AWS/GCP
* Add monitoring & logging

**Phase 5 — Expansion:**

* Visualize user sentiment trends
* Explore reinforcement learning for adaptive responses
* Integrate into real-world platforms (Slack, mobile app, etc.)

---

## Next Steps

* Flesh out dataset pipeline.
* Decide on first model architecture (baseline sentiment model).
* Draft first system architecture diagram.
* Continue building out FastAPI routes.
